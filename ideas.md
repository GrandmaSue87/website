# Ideas for Later

- Add a tiny chime play button near the welcome line on the homepage.
- Add a page-turn animation for the book spread (two square pages side-by-side).
- Add a “note from Grandma Sue” styling for book descriptions (possibly with a signature).
- Revisit and refine homepage tag labels (Vinyl/Storybook/Original).
- Social preview warmth (future hook testing for share titles/descriptions).
