## Project overview
- We are building a simple website to host digital books for retro read along records.
- Each book can include audio and video portions.
- The site is called "Grandma Sue's Library" (Retro Read-Along Records).
- The short-term goal is a simple, working library homepage plus individual book pages.

## How to work with me
- I am a non-coder.
- Ask me questions one at a time.
- Keep explanations short and direct.
- Avoid overwhelming me with too much information.
- I have ADHD and get overwhelmed easily.
- Do not start coding until I explicitly approve.

## Desired help
- Help me plan the site structure and content.
- Help me design simple, clear pages.
- Suggest next steps in small, manageable chunks.

## Style preferences
- Vibe: midcentury modern grandmother's library; warm, cozy, nostalgic, but uncluttered and simple.
- Feel: light and airy; like snuggling by the hearth with cookies and stories.
- Background: soft paper/linen feel with faint, rounded shapes.
- Palette: warm wood + soft sage, creamy paper base, muted teal accent.
- Typography: storybook/classic for headings; clean, friendly sans for body.
- Thumbnails: square book covers; simple and consistent.

## Site structure
- Home page is the library with a hero and a grid of 8 book covers.
- One new book is added each Sunday evening.
- Each book has its own page.
- Future: About page and Listener Club/opt-in page.

## Homepage content
- Title: "Grandma Sue's Library".
- Hero text: "Welcome to the classic fairytale library of P.A.I.G.E and Grandma Sue. You'll know it's time to turn the page, when you hear this sound..."
- Helper line: "New books arrive every Sunday evening."
- Cards show cover, tags (category/collection/year), title, and a short warm one-liner.

## Book page layout
- Top block: two columns with cover on the right and title/description on the left.
- Show basic info/tags (author, illustrator, narrator, collection, year, origin/context).
- Viewer: two-page spread (two square pages side-by-side) with left/right controls.
- Action icons (large and very clear): audio, YouTube, podcast, Amazon (only for originals later).
- Include hover tooltips on action icons and a short helper line.

## Content checklist (weekly)
- Cover image (square).
- Two-page spreads (pair square pages into wide spreads).
- Audio file.
- YouTube link.
- Podcast link.
- Optional Amazon link.
- Title + short warm description.
- Basic info and tags.

## Interaction ideas (later)
- Add a tiny chime play button near the welcome line.
- Add a page-turn animation for the spread viewer.

## Open decisions
- Finalize exact color palette values and font choices.
- Decide if/when to add search and filters (category/collection).
